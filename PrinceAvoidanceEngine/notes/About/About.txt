A port of Princeoflight avoidance engine into GMS2 - https://github.com/princeoflight612/Princeoflight-Avoidance-Engine

Important:

Check "CoreScripts" to switch the gameplay mode between Avoidance or Ance.
Duplicate object "objSampleAvoidance" and the room "rBoss" and you're ready to go.

Make sure to place the object "objAvoidanceResetStats" (located in Avoidance folder) in the room before the boss. That object resets your stats (Score for Ance & HP for Avoidance).
